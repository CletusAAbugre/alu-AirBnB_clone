AirBnB Clone - The Console
This project is a simplified version of the AirBnB website. It focuses on building a backend interface (console) to manage the application's data. Users can interact with the console to create, update, delete, and retrieve objects, as well as manage file storage.

Features of the Console
Parent Class (BaseModel):

Handles initialization, serialization, and deserialization of objects.
Provides a structure for future instances.
Serialization and Deserialization Flow:

Converts an instance to a dictionary.
Converts the dictionary to a JSON string and stores it in a file.
Reads the JSON string from the file and converts it back into an instance.
Object-Oriented Design:

Includes classes such as User, State, City, Place, and more, which inherit from the BaseModel.
Storage Engine:

Implements a file storage engine for saving and retrieving data.
Unit Tests:

Comprehensive tests for all classes and storage engines to ensure correctness.
Command Interpreter
The command interpreter provides an interface to manage the application's objects. It supports the following operations:

Create: Create a new object (e.g., a User or a Place).
Retrieve: Fetch an object from storage (file, database, etc.).
Update: Modify attributes of an object.
Destroy: Remove an object.
Other Operations: Perform actions such as counting objects or computing statistics.
Supported Commands
Run the console and type help to see all available commands:

shell
Copy
Edit
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  create  delete  destroy  exit  help  q  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
How to Start the Console
Run the following command to start the console:

shell
Copy
Edit
$ ./console.py
Use commands like help, create, show, update, and destroy to interact with the application.

To exit the console, type:

shell
Copy
Edit
(hbnb) quit
Testing
To ensure the correctness of the project, unit tests have been implemented.

Run all tests:

shell
Copy
Edit
$ python3 -m unittest discover tests
Run a specific test:

shell
Copy
Edit
$ python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_city.py
